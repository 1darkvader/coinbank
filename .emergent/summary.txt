<analysis>
The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on a Next.js crypto banking platform, CoinBank. Initially, the focus was resolving persistent HTTP 502 errors and NextAuth authentication issues on a live preview environment. This involved extensive debugging of environment variables, NextAuth configurations, CORS middleware, and even database replica set setup. A significant challenge was the communication around preview environment updates versus local development, leading to repeated troubleshooting.

Eventually, the NextAuth setup was largely bypassed, and the engineer transitioned to building custom authentication and professional dashboards for both admin and regular users. This proved successful. The project then progressed to implementing core banking functionalities. As of the end of the trajectory, a robust Money Transfer system, Live Crypto Trading platform, and Bill Payment system have been successfully integrated into the user dashboard, demonstrating a strong focus on delivering feature-rich, professionally designed solutions.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a Sophisticated Crypto Banking Platform named CoinBank. Initial requirements focused on:
- **Design:** Consistent dark theme, professional logos/symbols.
- **Authentication:** Username/password login/signup, protected dashboard. Initially, NextAuth was used, but later replaced with a custom system due to persistent live environment issues. Predefined test accounts.
- **Navigation:** Professional header, functional dropdowns, dashboard access.
- **Content:** Creation of numerous professional pages (Products, Company, Support, Security, Banking).
- **Functionality:** Fix slow crypto ticker, restore AI chatbot, functional footer links.
- **Dashboard:** Comprehensive, modern user dashboard matching a specific design.
- **Error Resolution:** Fix 404s and persistent 502 HTTP errors on live preview, especially for NextAuth.
- **New Features (Phase 2):**
    - **User Banking:** Real Money Transfers, Live Crypto Trading, Bill Payment System, Investment Portfolio, Card Management.
    - **Admin Management:** User Account Management, Transaction Monitoring, System Analytics, Security Controls, Content Management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a significant phase of feature development. The user dashboard () has been fully rebuilt to precisely match client design requirements. Three major banking features have been successfully implemented and integrated: a comprehensive **Money Transfer System** with multi-step flows and contact management; an **Advanced Live Crypto Trading Platform** featuring real-time market data, trading interface, and portfolio management; and a **Comprehensive Bill Payment System** with multi-category support and auto-pay features. These features are modular, use robust state management, TypeScript, and Framer Motion for animations. The application is at a state where core user banking functionalities are professionally built and integrated, running successfully locally. The AI engineer is waiting for a user prompt to proceed with the next set of features, confirming the completion of Phase 2 of development.
