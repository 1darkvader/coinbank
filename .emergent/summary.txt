The previous AI engineer successfully migrated and enhanced a Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind, Framer Motion application into a sophisticated crypto banking platform named CoinBank. The process involved extensive iterative development driven by user feedback. Key achievements include implementing a consistent dark theme across various banking and security pages, creating numerous professional content pages for products, company, and support sections, speeding up the crypto price ticker, and restoring the AI chatbot functionality.

A major focus was on refining the authentication system, moving from a mock setup to a more robust NextAuth implementation with predefined test accounts, and ensuring the dashboard was fully protected. The most significant challenge encountered was a persistent 502 HTTP error on the live preview environment, which led to a migration from SQLite to MongoDB, extensive environment variable and NextAuth configuration adjustments, and CORS middleware implementation. Despite multiple fixes, the 502 error and authentication issues (CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR) continued to surface, indicating underlying deployment or infrastructure problems requiring further diagnosis. The work concluded with the AI planning to address the persistent 502 error on the live preview using insights from the deployment agent.

<product_requirements>
The user's overarching goal is to establish a Sophisticated Crypto Banking Platform called CoinBank. The initial framework was a Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma application.

**Core Requirements & Implemented Features:**
*   **Design & Theme:** Consistent black/dark background for all pages (excluding homepage initially, then consistently across banking/security pages). Professional logos and symbols.
*   **Authentication:** Transition from third-party OAuth to professional username/password login/signup. Predefined test accounts for easy testing. Dashboard to be protected and accessible only after login.
*   **Navigation:** Professional header navigation with a Home button. Functional dropdown menus for Products and Company sections. Dashboard access moved to a user account area.
*   **Page Content:** Creation and population of professional interfaces and data for numerous pages, including:
    *   Products: , , , , 
    *   Company: , , , , 
    *   Support: , , , ,  (implicitly addressed by  pages)
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Fix the slow crypto price ticker animation.
    *   Reintegrate and fix the AI chatbot functionality (restored after initial removal).
    *   Ensure footer links are functional, pointing to correct pages instead of .
*   **Dashboard:** Implement a comprehensive, modern dashboard interface matching a specific design (user provided image). This includes accounts, investments, referrals, card management, and an AI assistant.
*   **Error Resolution:** Address 404 errors for missing pages and persistent 502 HTTP errors on the live preview environment.

**Key Files & Changes:**
*   :  was changed from SQLite to MongoDB connection string.  and  are crucial for authentication.
*   : Modified to include  to address cross-origin request warnings during deployment.
*   : Completely rewritten to use MongoDB as the database provider instead of SQLite, with updated field types and model definitions to be compatible.
*   : Wraps children with  to enable NextAuth context.
*   : Defines and applies the dark/black theme ().
*   : The main homepage. Modified to include the  component and to replace the inline footer with dynamic links pointing to correct pages.
*   : Core NextAuth configuration. Simplified by removing Google/GitHub OAuth providers, fixed  logic, and removed PrismaAdapter usage for better MongoDB compatibility, also added  for deployment.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently focused on diagnosing and resolving a persistent HTTP 502 error on the live preview URL (). This error resurfaced despite previous efforts to fix it by migrating the database from SQLite to MongoDB, updating the Prisma schema for MongoDB compatibility, adjusting  and  variables, configuring Next.js for cross-origin requests (), and implementing CORS middleware ().

Most recently, the AI acknowledged that the backend testing passed with an 83% success rate, confirming API functionality and NextAuth operations locally. However, the user reported the 502 error still persists on the live preview. The AI has just called the deployment agent to get specific help in diagnosing the infrastructure or environment-related issues that might be causing this persistent 502 error, and is about to act on the deployment agent's latest recommendations. This indicates the primary focus is on resolving deployment-specific issues hindering live accessibility and login functionality.
